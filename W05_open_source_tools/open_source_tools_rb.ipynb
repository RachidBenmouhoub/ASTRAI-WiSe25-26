    "- The number of stars reflects how many users have saved the repository as a favorite.\n",

    "- A recent commit date often signifies that the project is being actively developed or maintained.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Issues and pull requests**: Active maintenance\n",
    "\n",
    "- The ratio of open to closed issues can show how actively the maintainers resolve problems. A large number of unresolved issues might signal a lack of maintenance. \n",
    "- Frequent and recent pull requests indicate active contributions and community engagement. \n",
    "- Look at the types of open issues (e.g., bugs, enhancements). Too many critical or unresolved bugs might be a red flag, while enhancement-focused issues can indicate active feature development.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **`README`**: Quality of documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "- A good `README` provides a clear overview of the package, including its purpose, main features, and usage. This can help determine if the project meets your needs.\n",
    "- Step-by-step installation and usage instructions makes it easier for new users to get started.\n",
